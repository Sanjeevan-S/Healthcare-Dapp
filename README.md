# Healthcare DApp 

## Description
The promise of blockchain has widespread implications for stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Capitalizing on this technology has the potential to connect fragmented systems to generate insights and to better assess the value of care. In the long term, a nationwide blockchain network for electronic medical records may improve efficiencies and support better health outcomes for patients.

1. Distributed framework for patient digital identities, which uses private and public blockchains secured through cryptography, creates a singular, more secure method of protecting patient identity. 

2. Each patients data like previous medical reports , information about major diseases and allergies will be stored in these blockchains. 

3. Smart contracts create a consistent, rule-based method for accessing patient data that can be permissioned to selected health organizations.

4. Insurance companies will define their conditions for getting accepted and the points not covered by the company . Depending on these conditions and relating those with the patients data insurance will be accepted or rejected .
